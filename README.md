FiqhCompare is a reference-based educational website designed to educate Muslims about comparative fiqh across the four major Islamic schools of thought: Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali. The website focuses on topics related to worship (e.g., purification, prayer, fasting, zakat, hajj) and provides side-by-side comparisons of rulings in both English and Arabic.
