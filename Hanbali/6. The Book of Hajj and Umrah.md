حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو بَكْرِ بْنُ أَبِي شَيْبَةَ، وَإِسْحَاقُ بْنُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ، جَمِيعًا عَنْ حَاتِمٍ، \- قَالَ أَبُو بَكْرٍ حَدَّثَنَا حَاتِمُ بْنُ إِسْمَاعِيلَ الْمَدَنِيُّ، \- عَنْ جَعْفَرِ بْنِ

‏.‏ فَسَأَلْتُهُ وَهُوَ أَعْمَى وَحَضَرَ وَقْتُ الصَّلاَةِ فَقَامَ فِي نِسَاجَةٍ مُلْتَحِفًا بِهَا كُلَّمَا وَضَعَهَا عَلَى مَنْكِبِهِ رَجَعَ طَرَفَاهَا إِلَيْهِ مِنْ صِغَرِهَا وَرِدَاؤُهُ إِلَى جَنْبِهِ عَلَى الْمِشْجَبِ فَصَلَّى بِنَا فَقُلْتُ أَخْبِرْنِي عَنْ حَجَّةِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏.‏ فَقَالَ بِيَدِهِ فَعَقَدَ تِسْعًا فَقَالَ إِنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم

بِرَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَيَعْمَلَ مِثْلَ عَمَلِهِ فَخَرَجْنَا مَعَهُ حَتَّى أَتَيْنَا ذَا الْحُلَيْفَةِ فَوَلَدَتْ أَسْمَاءُ بِنْتُ عُمَيْسٍ مُحَمَّدَ بْنَ أَبِي بَكْرٍ فَأَرْسَلَتْ إِلَى رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم كَيْفَ أَصْنَعُ قَالَ ‏"‏ اغْتَسِلِي وَاسْتَثْفِرِي بِثَوْبٍ وَأَحْرِمِي ‏"‏ ‏.‏ فَصَلَّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم فِي الْمَسْجِدِ ثُمَّ رَكِبَ الْقَصْوَاءَ حَتَّى إِذَا اسْتَوَتْ بِهِ نَاقَتُهُ عَلَى الْبَيْدَاءِ نَظَرْتُ إِلَى مَدِّ بَصَرِي بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ مِنْ رَاكِبٍ وَمَاشٍ وَعَنْ يَمِينِهِ مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ وَعَنْ يَسَارِهِ مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِ مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ وَرَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم بَيْنَ أَظْهُرِنَا وَعَلَيْهِ يَنْزِلُ الْقُرْآنُ وَهُوَ يَعْرِفُ تَأْوِيلَهُ وَمَا عَمِلَ بِهِ مِنْ شَىْءٍ عَمِلْنَا بِهِ فَأَهَلَّ بِالتَّوْحِيدِ ‏"‏ لَبَّيْكَ اللَّهُمَّ لَبَّيْكَ لَبَّيْكَ لاَ شَرِيكَ لَكَ لَبَّيْكَ إِنَّ الْحَمْدَ وَالنِّعْمَةَ لَكَ وَالْمُلْكَ لاَ شَرِيكَ لَكَ ‏"‏ ‏.‏ وَأَهَلَّ النَّاسُ بِهَذَا الَّذِي يُهِلُّونَ بِهِ فَلَمْ يَرُدَّ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم عَلَيْهِمْ شَيْئًا مِنْهُ وَلَزِمَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم تَلْبِيَتَهُ قَالَ جَابِرٌ \- رضى الله عنه \- لَسْنَا نَنْوِي إِلاَّ الْحَجَّ لَسْنَا نَعْرِفُ الْعُمْرَةَ حَتَّى إِذَا أَتَيْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَعَهُ اسْتَلَمَ الرُّكْنَ فَرَمَلَ ثَلاَثًا وَمَشَى أَرْبَعًا ثُمَّ نَفَذَ إِلَى مَقَامِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ \- عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ \- فَقَرَأَ ‏{‏ وَاتَّخِذُوا مِنْ مَقَامِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ مُصَلًّى‏}‏ فَجَعَلَ الْمَقَامَ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ الْبَيْتِ فَكَانَ أَبِي يَقُولُ وَلاَ أَعْلَمُهُ ذَكَرَهُ إِلاَّ عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى

الصَّفَا فَلَمَّا دَنَا مِنَ الصَّفَا قَرَأَ ‏{‏ إِنَّ الصَّفَا وَالْمَرْوَةَ مِنْ شَعَائِرِ اللَّهِ‏}‏ ‏"‏ أَبْدَأُ بِمَا بَدَأَ اللَّهُ بِهِ ‏"‏ ‏.‏ فَبَدَأَ بِالصَّفَا فَرَقِيَ عَلَيْهِ حَتَّى رَأَى الْبَيْتَ فَاسْتَقْبَلَ الْقِبْلَةَ فَوَحَّدَ اللَّهَ وَكَبَّرَهُ وَقَالَ ‏"‏ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كَلِّ شَىْءٍ

الْمَرْوَةِ حَتَّى إِذَا انْصَبَّتْ قَدَمَاهُ فِي بَطْنِ الْوَادِي سَعَى حَتَّى إِذَا صَعِدَتَا مَشَى حَتَّى أَتَى الْمَرْوَةَ فَفَعَلَ عَلَى الْمَرْوَةِ كَمَا فَعَلَ عَلَى الصَّفَا حَتَّى إِذَا كَانَ

يَقُولُ بِالْعِرَاقِ فَذَهَبْتُ إِلَى رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم مُحَرِّشًا عَلَى فَاطِمَةَ لِلَّذِي صَنَعَتْ مُسْتَفْتِيًا لِرَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم فِيمَا ذَكَرَتْ عَنْهُ فَأَخْبَرْتُهُ أَنِّي أَنْكَرْتُ ذَلِكَ عَلَيْهَا فَقَالَ ‏"‏ صَدَقَتْ صَدَقَتْ مَاذَا قُلْتَ حِينَ فَرَضْتَ الْحَجَّ ‏"‏ ‏.‏ قَالَ قُلْتُ اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أُهِلُّ بِمَا أَهَلَّ بِهِ رَسُولُكَ ‏.‏ قَالَ ‏"‏ فَإِنَّ مَعِيَ الْهَدْىَ فَلاَ تَحِلُّ ‏"‏ ‏.‏ قَالَ فَكَانَ جَمَاعَةُ الْهَدْىِ الَّذِي قَدِمَ بِهِ عَلِيٌّ مِنَ الْيَمَنِ وَالَّذِي أَتَى بِهِ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم مِائَةً \- قَالَ \- فَحَلَّ النَّاسُ كُلُّهُمْ وَقَصَّرُوا إِلاَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَمَنْ كَانَ مَعَهُ هَدْىٌ فَلَمَّا كَانَ يَوْمُ التَّرْوِيَةِ تَوَجَّهُوا إِلَى مِنًى فَأَهَلُّوا بِالْحَجِّ وَرَكِبَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَصَلَّى بِهَا الظُّهْرَ وَالْعَصْرَ وَالْمَغْرِبَ وَالْعِشَاءَ وَالْفَجْرَ ثُمَّ مَكَثَ قَلِيلاً حَتَّى طَلَعَتِ الشَّمْسُ وَأَمَرَ بِقُبَّةٍ مِنْ شَعَرٍ تُضْرَبُ لَهُ بِنَمِرَةَ فَسَارَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَلاَ تَشُكُّ قُرَيْشٌ إِلاَّ أَنَّهُ وَاقِفٌ عِنْدَ الْمَشْعَرِ الْحَرَامِ كَمَا كَانَتْ قُرَيْشٌ تَصْنَعُ فِي الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ

الْفَضْلَ بْنَ عَبَّاسٍ وَكَانَ رَجُلاً حَسَنَ الشَّعْرِ أَبْيَضَ وَسِيمًا فَلَمَّا دَفَعَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم مَرَّتْ بِهِ ظُعُنٌ يَجْرِينَ فَطَفِقَ الْفَضْلُ يَنْظُرُ إِلَيْهِنَّ فَوَضَعَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَدَهُ عَلَى وَجْهِ الْفَضْلِ فَحَوَّلَ الْفَضْلُ وَجْهَهُ إِلَى الشِّقِّ الآخَرِ يَنْظُرُ فَحَوَّلَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَدَهُ مِنَ الشِّقِّ الآخَرِ عَلَى وَجْهِ الْفَضْلِ يَصْرِفُ وَجْهَهُ مِنَ الشِّقِّ الآخَرِ يَنْظُرُ حَتَّى أَتَى بَطْنَ مُحَسِّرٍ فَحَرَّكَ قَلِيلاً ثُمَّ سَلَكَ الطَّرِيقَ الْوُسْطَى الَّتِي تَخْرُجُ عَلَى الْجَمْرَةِ

Ja'far b Muhammad reported on the authority of his father: We went to Jabir b. Abdullah and he began inquiring about the people (who had gone to see him) till it was my turn. 

I said: I am Muhammad b. 'Ali b. Husain. 

He placed his hand upon my head and opened my upper button and then the lower one and then placed his palm on my chest (in order to bless me), and I was, during those days, a young boy, and he said: You are welcome, my nephew. Ask whatever you want to ask. 

And I asked him but as he was blind (he could not respond to me immediately), and the time for prayer came. He stood up covering himself in his mantle. And whenever he placed its ends upon his shoulders they slipped down on account of being short (in size). Another mantle was, however, lying on the clothes rack near by. And he led us in the prayer. 

I said to him: Tell me about the Hajj of Allah's Messenger (May peace be upon him). 

And he pointed with his hand nine, and then stated: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stayed in (Medina) for nine years but did not perform Hajj, then he made a public announcement in the tenth year to the effect that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was about to perform the Hajj. 

A large number of persons came to Medina and all of them were anxious to follow the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) and do according to his doing. We set out with him till we reached Dhu'l-Hulaifa. 

Asma' daughter of Umais gave birth to Muhammad b. Abu Bakr. She sent message to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) asking him: What should I do? 

He (the Holy Prophet) said: Take a bath, bandage your private parts and put on Ihram. 

The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) then prayed in the mosque and then mounted al-Qaswa (his she-camel) and it stood erect with him on its back at al-Baida'. And I saw as far as I could see in front of me but riders and pedestrians, and also on my right and on my left and behind me like this. And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was prominent among us and the (revelation) of the Holy Qur'an was descending upon him. And it is he who knows (its true) significance. And whatever he did, we also did that. 

He pronounced the Oneness of Allah (saying): " Labbaik, Allah, Labbaik, Labbaik. Thou hast no partner, praise and grace is Thine and the Sovereignty too; Thou hast no partner." And the people also pronounced this Talbiya which they pronounce (today). 

The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) did not reject anything out of it. But the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) adhered to his own Talbiya. 

Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) said: We did not have any other intention but that of Hajj only, being unaware of the Umra (at that season), but when we came with him to the House, he touched the pillar and (made seven circuits) running three of them and walking four. And then going to the Station of Ibrahim, he recited: " And adopt the Station of Ibrahim as a place of prayer." And this Station was between him and the House. My father said (and I do not know whether he had made a mention of it but that was from Allah's Apostle \[May peace be upon him\] that he recited in two rak'ahs: " say: He is Allah One," and say: " Say: 0 unbelievers." 

He then returned to the pillar (Hajar Aswad) and kissed it. He then went out of the gate to al-Safa' and as he reached near it he recited: " Al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the signs appointed by Allah," (adding: ) I begin with what Allah (has commanded me) to begin. He first mounted al-Safa' till he saw the House, and facing Qibla he declared the Oneness of Allah and glorified Him, and said: " There is no god but Allah, One, there is no partner with Him. His is the Sovereignty. to Him praise is due. and He is Powerful over everything. There is no god but Allah alone, Who fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and routed the confederates alone." 

He then made supplication in the course of that saying such words three times. He then descended and walked towards al-Marwa, and when his feet came down in the bottom of the valley, he ran, and when he began to ascend he walked till he reached al-Marwa. There he did as he had done at al-Safa'. 

And when it was his last running at al-Marwa he said: If I had known beforehand what I have come to know afterwards, I would not have brought sacrificial animals and would have performed an 'Umra. So, he who among you has not the sacrificial animals with him should put off Ihram and treat it as an Umra. 

Suraqa b. Malik b. Ju'sham got up and said: Messenger of Allah, does it apply to the present year, or does it apply forever? Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) intertwined the fingers (of one hand) into another and said twice: The 'Umra has become incorporated in the Hajj (adding): " No, but for ever and ever." 

'Ali came from the Yemen with the sacrificial animals for the Prophet (May peace be upon him) and found Fatimah (Allah be pleased with her) to be one among those who had put off Ihram and had put on dyed clothes and had applied antimony. He (Hazrat Ali) showed disapproval to it, whereupon she said: My father has commanded me to do this. 

He (the narrator) said that 'Ali used to say in Iraq: I went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) showing annoyance at Fatimah for what she had done, and asked the (verdict) of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) regarding what she had narrated from him, and told him that I was angry with her, whereupon he said: She has told the truth, she has told the truth. 

(The Prophet then asked 'Ali): What did you say when you undertook to go for Hajj? 

I ('Ali) said: 0 Allah, I am putting on Ihram for the same purpose as Thy Messenger has put it on. 

He said: I have with me sacrificial animals, so do not put off the Ihram. 

He (Jabir) said: The total number of those sacrificial animals brought by 'Ali from the Yemen and of those brought by the Apostle (ﷺ) was one hundred. 

Then all the people except the Apostle (ﷺ) and those who had with them sacrificial animals, put off Ihram, and got their hair clipped; 

when it was the day of Tarwiya (8th of Dhu'l-Hijja) they went to Mina and put on the Ihram for Hajj and the Messenger of Ailah (ﷺ) rode and led the noon, afternoon, sunset, 'Isha' and dawn prayers. He then waited a little till the sun rose, and commanded that a tent of hair should be pitched at Namira. 

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then set out and the Quraish did not doubt that he would halt at al-Mash'ar al-Haram (the sacred site) as the Quraish used to do in the pre-Islamic period. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), however, passed on till he came to 'Arafa and he found that the tent had been pitched for him at Namira. There he got down till the sun had passed the meridian; he commanded that al-Qaswa should be brought and saddled for him. 

Then he came to the bottom of the valley, and addressed the people saying: Verily your blood, your property are as sacred and inviolable as the sacredness of this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this town of yours. Behold\! Everything pertaining to the Days of Ignorance is under my feet completely abolished. Abolished are also the blood-revenges of the Days of Ignorance. The first claim of ours on blood-revenge which I abolish is that of the son of Rabi'a b. al-Harith, who was nursed among the tribe of Sa'd and killed by Hudhail. And the usury of the pre-Islamic period is abolished, and the first of our usury I abolish is that of 'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib, for it is all abolished. Fear Allah concerning women\! Verily you have taken them on the security of Allah, and intercourse with them has been made lawful unto you by words of Allah. You too have right over them, and that they should not allow anyone to sit on your bed whom you do not like. But if they do that, you can chastise them but not severely. Their rights upon you are that you should provide them with food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you the Book of Allah, and if you hold fast to it, you would never go astray. And you would be asked about me (on the Day of Resurrection), (now tell me) what would you say? 

They (the audience) said: We will bear witness that you have conveyed (the message), discharged (the ministry of Prophethood) and given wise (sincere) counsel. 

He (the narrator) said: He (the Holy Prophet) then raised his forefinger towards the sky and pointing it at the people (said): " O Allah, be witness. 0 Allah, be witness," saying it thrice. 

(Bilal then) pronounced Adhan and later on Iqama and he (the Holy Prophet) led the noon prayer. He (Bilal) then uttered Iqama and he (the Holy Prophet) led the afternoon prayer and he observed no other prayer in between the two. 

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then mounted his camel and came to the place of stay, making his she-camel al-Qaswa, turn towards the side where there we’re rocks, having the path taken by those who went on foot in front of him, and faced the Qibla. He kept standing there till the sun set, and the yellow light had somewhat gone, and the disc of the sun had disappeared. He made Usama sit behind him, and he pulled the nosestring of Qaswa so forcefully that its head touched the saddle (in order to keep her under perfect control), and he pointed out to the people with his right hand to be moderate (in speed), and whenever he happened to pass over an elevated tract of sand, he slightly loosened it (the nose-string of his camel) till she climbed up and this is how he reached al-Muzdalifa. 

There he led the evening and 'Isha prayers with one Adhan and two Iqamas and did not glorify (Allah) in between them (i. e. he did not observe supererogatory rak'ahs between Maghrib and 'Isha' prayers). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then laid down till dawn and offered the dawn prayer with an Adhan and Iqama when the morning light was clear. He again mounted al-Qaswa, and when he came to al-Mash'ar al-Haram, he faced towards Qibla, supplicated Him, Glorified Him, and pronounced His Uniqueness (La ilaha illa Allah) and Oneness, and kept standing till the daylight was very clear. 

He then went quickly before the sun rose, and seated behind him was al-Fadl b. 'Abbas and he was a man having beautiful hair and fair complexion and handsome face. As the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) was moving on, there was also going a group of women (side by side with them). Al-Fadl began to look at them. 

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) placed his hand on the face of Fadl who then turned his face to the other side, and began to see, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turned his hand to the other side and placed it on the face of al-Fadl. He again turned his face to the other side till he came to the bottom of Muhassir. 

He urged her (al-Qaswa) a little, and, following the middle road, which comes out at the greatest jamra, he came to the jamra which is near the tree. At this he threw seven small pebbles, saying Allah-o-Akbar while throwing every one of them in a manner in which the small pebbles are thrown (with the help of fingers) and this he did in the bottom of the valley. 

He then went to the place of sacrifice, and sacrificed sixty-three (camels) with his own hand. Then he gave the remaining number to 'All who sacrificed them, and he shared him in his sacrifice. He then commanded that a piece of flesh from each animal sacrificed should be put in a pot, and when it was cooked, both of them (the Prophet and Hadrat 'All) took some meat out of it and drank its soup. 

The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) again rode and came to the House, and offered the Zuhr prayer at Mecca. He came to the tribe of Abd al-Muttalib, who were supplying water at Zamzam, and said: Draw water. O Bani 'Abd al-Muttalib; were it not that people would usurp this right of supplying water from you, I would have drawn it along with you. So they handed him a basket and he drank from it.
