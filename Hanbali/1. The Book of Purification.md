The Book of Purification

#### Chapter 1: Rulings on the Types of Water

* Water was created pure and is purifying. It purifies from ritual impurities (nullifiers of wudu and ghusl) and physical impurities  
* Purity can't be attained by any other liquid  
* 4 types of water:  
  * Plain water (includes seas, rivers, rain, snow, hail, and wells)  
  * Used water (water used to remove spiritual impurity)  
  * Water mixed with pure substances  
  * Water mixed with impure substances  
* 3 categories of water:  
  * Pure \+ purifying  
  * Pure \+ not purifying (ex. Tea and ink)  
  * Impure (urine, menstrual blood, etc)  
* When water amounts to *qullatayn* (around 190 liters or about 50 gallons) or is flowing, it can’t become impure EXCEPT if something changes its color, taste, or smell  
* Water less than qullatayn becomes impure by any mixing with impurities  
* If you have doubts regarding the purity/impurity of water/something else, base your actions on certainty (“certainty is not negated by doubt”)  
* If pure water was indistinguishable from impure water (if someone loses his/her sense or in the dark), and you don’t find any other water, make tayammum and avoid the water  
* If pure \+ purifying water is confused with pure \+ not purifying, then you should make wudu out of each of them   
* Impurity from the dog and the pig should be washed 7 times, including once with soil  
* It is sufficient for all other impurities to be washed 3 times until purified (the other view is that whatever will remove the impurity is sufficient  
* Removing impurity:  
  * On the ground: pour water over it  
  * Urine from a male infant who has not yet started eating regular/solid food: wet the area affected without soaking is sufficient  
  * Madhiy (prostatic secretion): wet the area affected without soaking is sufficient  
* The semen of a human \= pure  
* The urine of the animals whose flesh can be eaten \= pure

#### Chapter 2: Vessels and Utensils

* Gold and silver vessel used for purification or otherwise (eating, storing makeup, etc) is not lawful to use  
* Vessels soldered with gold/silver is also not lawful unless it is with a small amount of silver solder  
* Permissible to use all other pure vessels, to possess them, and to use the vessels of the People of the Book and their clothes (unless they are known to be impure)  
* Wool and hair of dead animals (animals that have not been slaughtered or those that are impermissible to eat) \= pure  
* Skin and bones of any non-slaughtered dead animal \= impure  
* Every dead body \= filthy EXCEPT a human’s and a sea creature that only lives in the sea and that which does not have blood (as long as it did not emanate from impurities)

#### Chapter 3: Using the Lavatory

* What to say when entering the toilet:

حَدَّثَنَا عَمْرُو بْنُ مَرْزُوقٍ، أَخْبَرَنَا شُعْبَةُ، عَنْ قَتَادَةَ، عَنِ النَّضْرِ بْنِ أَنَسٍ، عَنْ زَيْدِ بْنِ أَرْقَمَ، عَنْ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏ "‏ إِنَّ هَذِهِ الْحُشُوشَ مُحْتَضَرَةٌ فَإِذَا أَتَى أَحَدُكُمُ الْخَلاَءَ فَلْيَقُلْ أَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ مِنَ الْخُبُثِ وَالْخَبَائِثِ ‏"‏ ‏.‏

Narrated Zayd ibn Arqam:  
The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: These privies are frequented by the jinns and devils. So when anyone amongst you goes there, he should say: "I seek refuge in Allah from male and female devils."

* What to say when exiting: 

حَدَّثَنَا مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ إِسْمَاعِيلَ، حَدَّثَنَا مَالِكُ بْنُ إِسْمَاعِيلَ، عَنْ إِسْرَائِيلَ بْنِ يُونُسَ، عَنْ يُوسُفَ بْنِ أَبِي بُرْدَةَ، عَنْ أَبِيهِ، عَنْ عَائِشَةَ، رضى الله عنها قَالَتْ كَانَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم إِذَا خَرَجَ مِنَ الْخَلاَءِ قَالَ ‏ "‏ غُفْرَانَكَ ‏"‏ ‏.‏ قَالَ أَبُو عِيسَى هَذَا حَدِيثٌ حَسَنٌ غَرِيبٌ لاَ نَعْرِفُهُ إِلاَّ مِنْ حَدِيثِ إِسْرَائِيلَ عَنْ يُوسُفَ بْنِ أَبِي بُرْدَةَ ‏.‏ وَأَبُو بُرْدَةَ بْنُ أَبِي مُوسَى اسْمُهُ عَامِرُ بْنُ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ قَيْسٍ الأَشْعَرِيُّ ‏.‏ وَلاَ نَعْرِفُ فِي هَذَا الْبَابِ إِلاَّ حَدِيثَ عَائِشَةَ رضى الله عنها عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏.‏

'Aishah, \[may Allah be pleased with her\] said: "When the Prophet would exit the toilet he would say: 'Ghufranak.'"

حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو الْيَمَانِ، قَالَ أَخْبَرَنَا شُعَيْبٌ، عَنِ الزُّهْرِيِّ، قَالَ أَخْبَرَنِي عَطَاءُ بْنُ يَزِيدَ، عَنْ حُمْرَانَ، مَوْلَى عُثْمَانَ بْنِ عَفَّانَ أَنَّهُ رَأَى عُثْمَانَ دَعَا بِوَضُوءٍ، فَأَفْرَغَ عَلَى يَدَيْهِ مِنْ إِنَائِهِ، فَغَسَلَهُمَا ثَلاَثَ مَرَّاتٍ، ثُمَّ أَدْخَلَ يَمِينَهُ فِي الْوَضُوءِ، ثُمَّ تَمَضْمَضَ، وَاسْتَنْشَقَ، وَاسْتَنْثَرَ، ثُمَّ غَسَلَ وَجْهَهُ ثَلاَثًا وَيَدَيْهِ إِلَى الْمِرْفَقَيْنِ ثَلاَثًا، ثُمَّ مَسَحَ بِرَأْسِهِ، ثُمَّ غَسَلَ كُلَّ رِجْلٍ ثَلاَثًا، ثُمَّ قَالَ رَأَيْتُ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَتَوَضَّأُ نَحْوَ وُضُوئِي هَذَا وَقَالَ ‏ "‏ مَنْ تَوَضَّأَ نَحْوَ وُضُوئِي هَذَا ثُمَّ صَلَّى رَكْعَتَيْنِ، لاَ يُحَدِّثُ فِيهِمَا نَفْسَهُ، غَفَرَ اللَّهُ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ ‏"‏‏.‏

Narrated Humran: (the freed slave of \`Uthman bin \`Affan) I saw \`Uthman bin \`Affan asking (for a tumbler of water) to perform ablution (and when it was brought) he poured water from it over his hands and washed them thrice and then put his right hand in the water container and rinsed his mouth and washed his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it out. Then he washed his face thrice and (then) forearms up to the elbows thrice, then passed his wet hands over his head and then washed each foot thrice. After that \`Uthman said, "I saw the Prophet (ﷺ) performing ablution like this of mine, and he said, 'If anyone performs ablution like that of mine and offers a two-rak\`at prayer during which he does not think of anything else (not related to the present prayer) then his past sins will be forgiven. '

  * The beginner  
    * If a woman has just started menstruating for a period that is customary for menstruation (1-15 days), then she must abstain from the forbidden acts  
    * If it stops short of 1 day and 1 night, it is not menstruation  
    * If it exceeds 1 day and 1 night, but does not exceed the longest period of menstruation (15 days), then it is menstruation  
    * If it recurs with the same form and duration for 3 months, it becomes an established cycle (for majority, it is 1 cycle)  
    * If it exceeds the longest duration for menstruation (15 days), then whatever is beyond is non-menstrual vaginal bleeding  
      * In this case, she must do ghusl at the end of the menstruation and wash her privates and wrap them  
      * Then she must perform wudu for every prayer time and pray
