The Book of Fasting

#### Chapter 1: Fasting in Ramadan

* Fasting in Ramadan is mandatory for every sane adult Muslim who is capable of fasting  
* A child should be ordered to fast when he can tolerate it (not mandatory for them)  
* Determining the beginning of Ramadan:  
  * Fasting becomes mandatory when 1 of 3 things occur:  
    * Completion of 30 days of Sha’ban  
    * Sighting of the crescent moon of Ramadan  
    * Presence of clouds on the night of the 30th of Sha’ban that prevents sighting  
  * If one Muslim alone sees the crescent, he should fast  
  * If he is trustworthy, people should fast based on his statement  
  * Multiplicity of sighting zones:  
    * Hanbalis and Hanafis say to disregard the multiplicity of sighting zones and accept the testimony of Muslims from any locality  
    * Shafi’is say every locality has its own sighting  
    * Malikis say multiplicity of sightings is only consequential when the localities are extremely far from each other  
    * People in every masjid/community should follow those in charge in their masjid  
  * People should not break the fast at the end of Ramadan unless it is based on the testimony of 2 trustworthy individuals  
  * If a captive is confused regarding the months, he should do his best to figure it out and fast  
    * If his fasting coincided with the start and or he fasted after it, then its valid  
    * If he started before it, it would not

#### Chapter 2: Those Exempt from Fasting

* Breaking the fast in Ramadan is permissible for 4 types of people:  
  * Someone sick who would be harmed by fasting and the traveler who is permitted to shorten the prayer  
    * For them, breaking the fast is preferable but if they fast, it is valid  
  * A menstruating woman and one having postpartum bleeding  
    * If they fast, it is not valid  
  * A pregnant woman and one who is breastfeeding  
    * If they fear for themselves, they break their fast and make it up  
    * If they fear for their unborn child, they break their fast, make up for it, and feed one poor individual per day (expiation binding on the father of the child or the one responsible for the child’s maintenance, slightly more than 1kg of wheat or any other food)  
    * If they fast, it will be valid  
  * Elderly or those with an incurable disease  
    * They should feed one poor individual per day  
* Expiation of fasts:  
  * For the rest of those who break their fast, they should only make up for it  
  * For those who broke their fast due to intercourse, he must make up for it and free a slave, if he can't then fast 2 consecutive months, if he can't then feed 60 individuals, if he can't then the burden is lifted  
    * If he had intercourse again before expiating then only 1 expiation needed  
  * If one delays making up the days until the next Ramadan comes and he has an excuse then he still needs to make it up  
  * If one delays and he has no excuse, then he should feed one poor individual per day   
  * If one delays making it up until he died, then nothing is required of him  
    * If there was no excuse then one poor individual should be fed per day on his behalf
