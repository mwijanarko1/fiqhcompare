The Book of Prayer

#### Importance of the Prayer

* 5 prayers are mandatory upon every adult, sane Muslim, except for the menstruating woman or the woman having postpartum bleeding  
* Whoever objects its obligation out of ignorance should be educated about it  
* If he rejects out of stubbornness, he becomes a disbeliever  
* If he abandons out of laziness, there’s a difference in opinion:  
  * According to Hanbalis, the person is a disbeliever (particularly if he/she preferred death to praying)  
  * According to majority, the person is a sinner; his/her disbelief is of the minor type, which is still worse than the major sins  
* Not permissible to defer it beyond its mandated time except for one who intends to combine it (with next prayer with a legitimate excuse) or one who is busy fulfilling its conditions  
* If one abandons it out of carelessness, he must be asked 3x to repent for it, if not, then he must be killed (according to Malikis, Shafi’is, and Hanbalis; locked up until he repents according to Hanafis)

#### Chapter 1: Adhan and Iqamah:

* Adhan and Iqamah are prescribed for the 5 prayers only, and for men only  
* They are communal obligations  
* The adhan contains 15 unique words (not counting repetition)  
* Iqamah contains 11 unique words  
* The mu’adh-dhin should be honest, with a good and loud voice, and should be knowledgeable about the times of prayers  
* Recommended to make adhan while standing, with wudu, and on a high place, facing the qibla  
* When he reach the “haya ‘ala…”, he should twist lightly to the right and left without moving your feet  
* He should put his index fingers in your ears, reciting the adhan slowly and the iqamah quickly  
* In the fajr adhan, he should say after the “haya ‘ala…”, as-salatu khairum-minan-naum 2x  
* He may not make adhan before the prescribed time except for the fajr prayer  
* It is recommended for those who hear the mu’adh-dhin to repeat what he says (except for after the “haya ‘ala…”  to which the sunnah is to say la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah

#### Chapter 2: Conditions of Prayer:

* 6 conditions:  
  * Ritual purity  
  * Commencement of the time  
    * Time for dhuhr is from the time the sun reaches its zenith until the time when the length of an object’s shadow becomes equal to the length of the object itself (plus the length of its shadow at the time of dhuhr because shadow does not completely vanish at dhuhr except at the equator)  
    * Time for asr is from the end of the time of dhuhr until the sun sets (time of preference \= adhan asr to when sun turns yellow, time of necessity \= sun turns yellow to sun set)  
    * Time for maghrib is from sunset until the red color of sunset disappears  
    * Time for isha is from when red color of sunset disappears to midnight (midway between maghrib and fajr) (Hanbalis say it’s not permitted to delay isha until after midnight without a reason, majority says it is only disliked)  
    * Time for fajr is from the rising of the second dawn until sunrise  
    * He who makes takbeer for the prayer before its time ends will have caught it  
    * Praying at the beginning of the time is better, except for isha and dhuhr (when it is excessively hot)  
  * Covering the awrah with that which does not show the complexion  
    * Awrah of the man is between the navel and the knees  
    * Awrah of a free woman is the entire body except for the face and hands  
    * Whoever prays in a garment/house that is wrongfully seized, his prayer will be invalid  
    * Wearing gold/silk is permissible for women but not for men, unless there is a need  
    * If a man prays in one garment, with part of it  on his shoulders, then this will suffice him  
    * If he only finds enough to cover his awrah, he should cover it  
    * If not enough to cover all of it, he should cover the two private parts (genitals and buttocks)  
    * If not enough for both, then he must cover one of them  
    * If he has nothing to cover with, he should pray sitting and must nod for his bowing and prostration  
    * If he prays standing, it is permissible  
    * One who can only find an impure garment or an impure place may pray in it, and he does not need to make up the prayers later  
  * Physical purity of the body, garment, and place of prayer, except for the impurity that is exempted, such as a little blood or the like  
    * If he prays with impurity on him that he is unaware of, or that he knew of but then forgot, then his prayer is valid  
    * If he knows of it while in the prayer, he must remove it and carry on with his prayer  
    * The entire earth is a place of prayer in which prayer is valid, except the graveyard, bathroom, lavatory, camel’s stables, and middle of the road  
  * Facing the qibla,   
    * except in the optional prayers: while riding, the traveler prays in whichever direction he is facing.   
    * One who is incapable of facing the qibla, out of fear or for some other reason, may pray in whichever direction he can  
    * For all others, their prayer is invalid unless they are facing the Kaaba  
    * If he is near it, he must pray exactly towards it  
    * If he is far, then towards its direction  
    * If qiblah is unknown to him while in a town, he must ask, and he may take for a clue the direction of the mihrabs of the Muslims  
    * If he errs, then he must make up for it  
    * If it is unknown to him while traveling, he should do his best to figure it out and pray, and he does not have to make up for it (if he erred)  
    * If two individuals capable of reasoning disagree, they need not follow each other  
    * A blind individual or layperson must follow the more trustworthy in his thinking  
  * The intention to perform the particular prayer  
    * It may be made shortly before the takbeer as long as he has not annulled it

#### Chapter 3: Etiquettes of Walking to the Prayer:

* It is recommended:  
  * To walk to the prayer with tranquility and solemnity  
  * To take short steps  
  * Not to interlace one’s fingers  
  * If he hears the iqamah, he should not walk hurriedly to it  
  * When the iqamah is called, there should be no prayer except the obligatory one  
  * When he arrives at the masjid, he should enter with his right foot first and say:

حَدَّثَنَا يَحْيَى بْنُ يَحْيَى، أَخْبَرَنَا سُلَيْمَانُ بْنُ بِلاَلٍ، عَنْ رَبِيعَةَ بْنِ أَبِي عَبْدِ الرَّحْمَنِ، عَنْ عَبْدِ الْمَلِكِ بْنِ سَعِيدٍ، عَنْ أَبِي حُمَيْدٍ، \- أَوْ عَنْ أَبِي أُسَيْدٍ، \- قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏ "‏ إِذَا دَخَلَ أَحَدُكُمُ الْمَسْجِدَ فَلْيَقُلِ اللَّهُمَّ افْتَحْ لِي أَبْوَابَ رَحْمَتِكَ ‏.‏ وَإِذَا خَرَجَ فَلْيَقُلِ اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ مِنْ فَضْلِكَ ‏"‏ ‏.‏ قَالَ مُسْلِمٌ سَمِعْتُ يَحْيَى بْنَ يَحْيَى يَقُولُ كَتَبْتُ هَذَا الْحَدِيثَ مِنْ كِتَابِ سُلَيْمَانَ بْنِ بِلاَلٍ ‏.‏ قَالَ بَلَغَنِي أَنَّ يَحْيَى الْحِمَّانِيَّ يَقُولُ وَأَبِي أُسَيْدٍ ‏.‏

Abu Usaid reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: When any one of you enters the mosque, he should say: " O Allah\! open for me the doors of Thy mercy" ; and when he steps out he should say: 'O Allah\! I beg of Thee Thy Grace." (Imam Muslim said: I heard Yahya saying: I transcribed this hadith from the compilation of Sulaiman b. Bilal.)

Sahih Muslim 713a

#### Chapter 4: Description of the Prayer:

* Read the chapter

#### Chapter 5: Pillars, Mandatory (wajib), and Sunnah Actions of the Prayer:

* The pillars are 12:  
  * Standing if capable  
  * The opening takbeer  
  * Recitation of Al Fatiha  
  * Bowing  
  * Rising from bowing  
  * Prostration  
  * Sitting after prostration  
  * Tranquility in all of these pillars (fully, without haste)  
  * The last tashahhud  
  * Sitting during the last tashahhud  
  * The first tasleem  
  * Following this order  
* Its mandatory actions are 7:  
  * Takbeer, other than the opening takbeer  
  * Exaltation of Allah in the bowing and prostration; once in each  
  * Saying “sami’ Allahu liman hamidah” and “rabbana laka alhamd”, both while rising from bowing  
  * Saying “rabbighfir-lee” between the two prostrations  
  * The first tashhahud  
  * Sitting for the first tashhahud  
  * Sending prayers unto the Prophet ﷺ in the last tashahhud  
  * If these acts are left out intentionally, the prayer is invalidated  
  * If left out of forgetfulness, the praying person should do the prostration of forgetfulness  
* Apart from these, the rest are preferable (sunnah) acts (read chapter 4\)  
* Prayer is not invalidated by intentionally leaving them out, and the prostration of forgetfulness is not mandatory in the case of forgetting them

#### Chapter 6: Two Prostrations of Forgetfulness:

* Types of forgetfulness:  
  * Addition  
    * Addition of an action that is similar to the actions of the prayer, such as adding an additional raka’ah or pillar  
    * Prayer is invalidated if done intentionally  
    * If done absentmindedly, prostration for forgetfulness must be done for it  
    * If one remembers while he is performing an additional raka’ah, he must sit down immediately  
    * If he makes tasleem while having missed a part of the prayer, he must perform that which he left out of it, and then prostrate  
    * If he does an action that is not similar to the actions of the prayer and it is not trivial, it invalidates it  
    * If it is trivial, then there is no harm  
  * Omission, such as forgetting a wajib action  
    * If he stands up before performing the first tashhahud and remembers before fully erect, he should go back and perform it  
    * If he remembers after he becomes fully erect, he should not go back  
    * If he forgets a **pillar** and remembers it before he begins the recital of another raka’ah, he must go back and perform it and whatever is after it  
    * If he remembers it after, then the raka’ah which he missed the pillar is invalidated  
  * Doubt  
    * Whoever doubts whether he has missed a pillar, it is as if he missed it  
    * Whoever doubts the number of raka’ahs he prayed must proceed on the basis of certainty, except for the imam, who proceeds on the basis of what is more probable  
* When to make the prostration of forgetfulness:  
  * Prescribed for every element that one forgets to perform are two prostrations before the tasleem, except for:  
    * One who makes tasleem too early, prior to actually completing his prayer  
    * The imam, if he proceeded on the basis of the more probable  
    * One who forgets to prostrate before the tasleem  
  * In those three, they should make two prostrations after the tasleem  
* About the ma’moom:  
  * The prostration of forgetfulness is not mandatory upon one who is led in the prayer except when his imam forgets, in which case he prostrates with him  
  * To alert the imam for a forgetfulness, say subhanallah for men and clapping for women

#### Chapter 7: Supererogatory Prayers:

* 5 types:  
  * Routine sunnah prayers   
    * 10 raka’ahs  
    * 2 before fajr   
    * 2 before dhuhr and 2 after  
    * 2 after maghrib at home  
    * 2 after isha at home  
  * Witr  
    * Between isha and fajr  
    * Minimum is 1 raka’ah and max is 11  
    * Minimum that is considered perfect is 3, with two tasleems  
  * General supererogatory prayers   
    * Supererogatory prayer at night is better than that of the day, and the latter half of the night is better for it than the first half  
    * Praying at night is two by two  
    * Prayer of one sitting is half in reward of that of the one standing  
  * What is prescribed to be prayed in congregation  
    * Taraweeh  
      * After isha in Ramadan  
    * Prayer for lunar or solar eclipse  
      * If eclipse happened, people must anxiously rush to the prayer  
      * Can either pray in congregation or individually  
      * One must say Allahu akbar, then al fatiha, then a long surah  
      * Then one bows a lengthy bow  
      * Then one rises and recites fatiha and surah that is long but shorter than the one before it  
      * Then one bows and lengthens the bowing, but shorter than the previous one  
      * Then one prostrates two lengthy prostrations  
      * Then one rises and does as he did in the first raka’ah, making a total of 4 bowings and 4 prostrations  
    * Prayer for rain  
      * If land becomes desolate and rain ceases to fall, people should go out with them imam while showing humbleness, destitution, humility, and imploring Allah  
      * Imam should lead them in praying 2 raka’ahs like those of the Eid prayer, then give a single sermon  
      * He is to ask for forgiveness repeatedly and earnestly, and recite the verses that beseech it. The people are to switch their outer garments around  
      * If the people of the covenant go out with them, they should not be prevented, and they should be ordered to be separate from the Muslims  
  * Prostration of Recital  
    * These are 14 prostrations  
    * Prostration is prescribed for both the one reciting and the one listening, but not for the one merely hearing  
    * He is to make takbeer when he prostrates and when he raises his head, and then he makes tasleem

#### Chapter 8: Times When Salah is Prohibited:

* There are 5:  
  * After fajr until sunrise  
  * After sun rises until it is one spear-length above the horizon  
  * From the time the sun is at its zenith until it moves to the west  
  * After asr until it is close to setting  
  * From that time until it actually sets  
* These are the times when voluntary prayers should not be performed except:  
  * Repeating a congregational prayer if it were called for while one is at the mosque  
  * The 2 raka’ahs after tawaf  
  * The funeral prayer  
  * Making up for the missed routine voluntary prayers  
* These prayers are permissible after fajr and after asr  
* Fardh prayers can be made up at all times

#### Chapter 9: Imamate:

وَحَدَّثَنَا مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ الْمُثَنَّى، وَابْنُ، بَشَّارٍ قَالَ ابْنُ الْمُثَنَّى حَدَّثَنَا مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ جَعْفَرٍ، عَنْ شُعْبَةَ، عَنْ إِسْمَاعِيلَ بْنِ رَجَاءٍ، قَالَ سَمِعْتُ أَوْسَ بْنَ ضَمْعَجٍ، يَقُولُ سَمِعْتُ أَبَا مَسْعُودٍ، يَقُولُ قَالَ لَنَا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏ "‏ يَؤُمُّ الْقَوْمَ أَقْرَؤُهُمْ لِكِتَابِ اللَّهِ وَأَقْدَمُهُمْ قِرَاءَةً فَإِنْ كَانَتْ قِرَاءَتُهُمْ سَوَاءً فَلْيَؤُمَّهُمْ أَقْدَمُهُمْ هِجْرَةً فَإِنْ كَانُوا فِي الْهِجْرَةِ سَوَاءً فَلْيَؤُمَّهُمْ أَكْبَرُهُمْ سِنًّا وَلاَ تَؤُمَّنَّ الرَّجُلَ فِي أَهْلِهِ وَلاَ فِي سُلْطَانِهِ وَلاَ تَجْلِسْ عَلَى تَكْرِمَتِهِ فِي بَيْتِهِ إِلاَّ أَنْ يَأْذَنَ لَكَ أَوْ بِإِذْنِهِ ‏"‏ ‏.‏

Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari reported: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to us: The one who is well grounded in Allah's Book and is distinguished among them in recitation should act as; Imam for the people. and if they are equally versed in reciting it, then the one who has most knowledge regarding Sunnah; if they are equal regarding the Sunnah, then the earliest one to emigrate; If they emigrated at the same time, then the oldest one in age. No man must lead another in prayer in latter's house or where (the latter) has authority, or sit in his place of honour in his house, except that he gives you permission or with his permission.

Sahih Muslim 673c  
[https://sunnah.com/muslim:673c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:673c)

* According to Hanafis, Malikis, and Shafi’is, the one with more knowledge takes precedence over the best reciter  
* According to Hanbalis, the hadith mentioned is clear in giving precedence to the one who has better recitation  
* Invalid Imamate:  
  * Prayer is not valid behind one whose prayer is invalid, except when one did not know about his ritual impurity and the one being led in the prayer know about it before he made tasleem  
  * In the exception case, the imam repeats his prayer alone  
  * When praying behind one who omits a major pillar of the prayer, except if the imam prays while sitting because of sickness that is hoped to be cured  
  * In this case, they pray behind him sitting, unless he began the prayer standing and became ill and sat down; then they would pray behind him standing  
  * Woman can’t lead men  
  * One with urinary incontinence can’t lead (Malikis and Shafi’is allow)  
  * The illiterate who does not recite Al Fatiha properly  
  * One who compromises a letter therein (pronunciation), except when they lead someone like them  
    * With regard to woman leading women, Shafi’is and Hanbalis allow while Hanafis and Malikis don’t allow a congregation of women  
    * With regard to those who try their best but are still unable to properly pronounce some letters:  
      * Shafi’is and Hanbalis say they should not lead the prayer  
      * Malikis allow  
* Permissible for:  
  * One who has wudu to pray behind one who has tayammum  
  * One who is praying an obligatory prayer to pray behind someone who is praying is a supererogatory prayer  
* Position of the Ma’moom:  
  * If there’s only 1: stand on the right side of the imam. If otherwise, then prayer not valid unless it’s a woman, then she should stand alone behind him  
  * If there’s group: they should stand behind him. If they stand to his right or on both sides, it’s valid. If they stand in front of him or to his left, it is invalid  
  * If a woman leads other women, she should stand between them in the same row  
  * Likewise for the imam of men who are not properly covered  
* Catching the Reward of the Congregation and Catching the Raka’ah:  
  * First position of the madhhab: He who makes takbeer before the tasleem of the imam has caught up with the congregation  
  * Second position of the madhhab: He must have caught one raka’ah  
  * He who catches the bowing has caught the raka’ah

#### Chapter 10: Prayer of the Sick Person:

حَدَّثَنَا عَبْدَانُ، عَنْ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ، عَنْ إِبْرَاهِيمَ بْنِ طَهْمَانَ، قَالَ حَدَّثَنِي الْحُسَيْنُ الْمُكْتِبُ، عَنِ ابْنِ بُرَيْدَةَ، عَنْ عِمْرَانَ بْنِ حُصَيْنٍ ـ رضى الله عنه ـ قَالَ كَانَتْ بِي بَوَاسِيرُ فَسَأَلْتُ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم عَنِ الصَّلاَةِ فَقَالَ ‏ "‏ صَلِّ قَائِمًا، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَسْتَطِعْ فَقَاعِدًا، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَسْتَطِعْ فَعَلَى جَنْبٍ ‏"‏‏.‏

Narrated \`Imran bin Husain: had piles, so I asked the Prophet (ﷺ) about the prayer. He said, "Pray while standing and if you can't, pray while sitting and if you cannot do even that, then pray Lying on your side."

Sahih al-Bukhari 1117  
[https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1117](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1117)

* Making up prayers missed during coma:  
  * Malikis and Shafi’is say that he/she is not required to make up any prayers unless he/she recovers from the coma before the time of the prayer is over  
  * Hanafis say that if the person is in a coma for more than five prayers, he/she does not need to make them up  
  * Hanbalis say that he/she must make up all the prayers, regardless of the duration of the coma  
  * Majority likened coma to insanity while Hanablis likened it to sleep  
* Combining prayers due to sickness:  
  * If it’s hard for him to pray each prayer during its prescribed time, it’s permissible to combine dhuhr with asr and maghrib with isha during the time of either one  
  * If he combines these during the time of the earlier prayer, he should make the intention to combine them  
  * The excuse for combining the two must continue until he starts praying the second  
  * He should not separate between them except for the time to make wudu  
  * If he defers to the time of the second prayer, the excuse of combining must last until the time of the second has come in  
  * He must make his intention to combine them during the time of the first prayer, before it is too late to pray it on time  
* Other times when combining prayers is permissible:  
  * 4 causes (agreed by Malikis, Shafi’is, and Hanbalis):  
    * Traveling  
    * Sickness  
    * Fear  
    * Rain (according to Hanbalis, severe wind and cold, and muddy streets (even without rain)  
    * Malikis and Shafi’is say these only applies to people praying at the mosque. Hanbalis say no  
    * Hanafis only allow combining during hajj  
  * Combining is permissible for the traveler for whom shortening the prayers is permissible  
  * It is permissible to combine the maghrib with isha in the case of rain (Malikis and Hanbalis). Shafi’is allow combining dhuhr and asr due to rain

#### Chapter 11: Prayer of the Traveler:

* If the distance of traveling is 16 farsakhs (88.7 km or 50.7 miles) and the travel is permissible, then one is entitled to shorten the 4 raka’ah prayers UNLESS:  
  * He prays behind a resident  
  * He does not intend to shorten   
  * He forgets a prayer that became due on him while a resident and remembers it while traveling  
  * He forgets a prayer that became due while traveling and he remembers it while a resident  
  * In these cases, he needs to do the full prayer  
* Permissible to pray the full prayer but shortening is preferable (Shafi’is agree with it being preferable, Hanafis say it’s obligatory to shorten, and Malikis say it’s a stressed sunnah)  
* He who has the intention to stay more than 21 prayers (4 days plus 1 prayer), must do full prayers  
* If he does not have this intention, he continues to shorten until:  
  * Hanafis say 14 days  
  * Malikis and Shafi’is say 4 days  
  * Hanbalis 21 prayers

#### Chapter 12: Prayer of Fear:

* Preferred way:   
  * imam divides the group into two, one guards while the other prays one raka’ah with the imam;
