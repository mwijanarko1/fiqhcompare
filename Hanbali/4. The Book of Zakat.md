The Book of Zakat

* Zakat must be paid by every free Muslim who has complete ownership of the wealth  
* If not full ownership, then you don’t have to pay zakat on it  
* Zakat must be paid on your wealth once an entire Islamic lunar year has passed  
* Zakat is only obligatory on 4 types of wealth:  
  * Free-grazing, domesticated livestock  
  * What is produced or extracted from the land  
  * Silver and gold  
  * Merchandise prepared for sale  
* There is no zakat on any of this until it reaches the nisab, a threshold  
* If the value reaches/exceeds the nisab, then zakat is obligatory on the full amount

#### Chapter 1: Zakat on free-grazing, domesticated livestock: 

* Camels  
  * For 1-24 camels: 1 sheep to be given as zakat for every 5 camels  
  * For 25-35 camels, the zakat on them would be a 1 year-old female camel (or a 2 year old male camel if one does not have the former) for every 5 camels

  * Then for every 50 camels, a 3 year old female camel must be paid  
  * For every 40 camels, a 2 year old female camel must be paid until they reach two hundred camels which: one may either pay four 3 year old female camels or five 2 year old female camels  
  * If one owes a camel of a certain age but can’t find it, he should pay one age level less than it plus 2 sheep or one age level higher than it and take 2 sheep  
* Cows  
  * There is no zakat on them until they reach 30 in number,  
  * For 30-39 cows, the zakat is a 1 year old male/female cow

  * For 60-69 cows, the zakat is two 1 year old cows  
  * For 70 cows, a 1 year old cow and a 2 year old female cow  
  * Then for every 30 cows, a 1 year old cow

  * Then for 201 sheep, the zakat is 3 sheep  
  * Then for every 100, the zakat is 1 sheep  
* Join ownership:  
  * If a group of people share the same nisab of free-grazing, domesticated livestock for an entire hawl, and their fields for pasture, stud animals, barns, milking sheds, and watering holes are the same, then the ruling on their zakat is as if they were one person  
  * Joint property has no effect except on free-grazing, domesticated livestock  
  *
