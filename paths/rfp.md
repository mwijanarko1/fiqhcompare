## Project Title: Development of FiqhCompare – A Comparative Fiqh Website

---

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 About the Project
FiqhCompare is a reference-based educational website designed to educate Muslims about comparative fiqh across the four major Islamic schools of thought: Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali. The website will focus on topics related to worship (e.g., purification, prayer, fasting, zakat, hajj) and provide side-by-side comparisons of rulings in both English and Arabic.

The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly, mobile-responsive, and visually appealing website that serves as a reliable resource for Muslims worldwide. The website will include:
- Side-by-side comparative tables for rulings.
- Bilingual content (English and Arabic).
- An admin panel for easy content management.
- Integration with Firebase for data storage and authentication.

#### 1.2 Target Audience
The primary audience includes general Muslims seeking to understand differences in fiqh rulings across madhhabs. The content will cater to both English-speaking and Arabic-speaking users.
